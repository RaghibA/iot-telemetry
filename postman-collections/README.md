# Using the Postman collection

This collection has every request you need to set up the tools. I've gone ahead and add the enviornment files as well. Import both and make sure the iot telemetry envirnment is selected. You can then send the requests in the order described in the readme at the project root.

Scripts have been added where necessary so you shouldn't have to copy any data from one request to the next.

Postman does not allow export of websocket collections so you will have to set that up. To do this look at the last section of the readme at the project root.
